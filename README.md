# FinalProjectNeuroAI
## Objective
Exploring Hopfields’ associative memory with Hebbian Learning on Cat & Dog Images. \\
In this project, we used a base model Hopfield Network using hebbian learning to store dog and cat patterns. There were several things tried out: 
- The amount of neurons (nodes)
- Binarizing the image or not.

### Before running the code it is important to run the following commands in your vs code terminal order to get the neccesary packeges and dependencies:
conda env create -f environment.yml \
conda activate Minor

### Once done working on the code for the day, it is important to deactivate the environment and you can do that with the following command:
conda deactivate
